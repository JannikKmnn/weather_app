# weather_app
Application to check weather datas of my hometown. The code uses API-requests from ["openweathermap"](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Make sure to set you own API-id ["here"](https://github.com/JannikKmnn/weather_app/blob/master/weather.js#L15).

Program runs locally in the browser. On my way to outsource it to NodeJS.
